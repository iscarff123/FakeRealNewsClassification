# Fake vs. Real News Classification
### Time of Project: Spring 2020
### Class Project
### Masters of Science in Data Analytics, UTSA

For this project, my classmates and I examined various news stories that were real or fake. The goal of this project was to develop a classification model to predict which news articles were real or fake based on the frequencies of 100 words. We tested and compared logistic regression, neural networks, basic tree, and random forest models, with the neural network performing the best.
